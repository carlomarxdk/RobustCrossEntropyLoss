# Robust Cross Entropy Loss

Simple PyTorch implementation of **Robust Cross Entropy Loss** from [Making deep neural networks robust to label noise: A loss correction approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03683.pdf):
* For now it only implements **Forward method**,
* Inspired by [the following Keras implementation](https://github.com/giorgiop/loss-correction).
