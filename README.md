# RobustCrossEntropyLoss

Simple PyTorch implementation of **Robust Cross Entropy Loss** from [Making deep neural networks robust to label noise: A loss correction approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03683.pdf). Inspired by (the following implementation)[https://github.com/giorgiop/loss-correction].

For now it only implements **Forward method**.
